# Contributing

Ternary is still a very early-stage project, thus the codebase is rapidly changing.

Before opening a pull request, please open an issue and discuss whether the change makes sense in Ternary. Ensuring a cohesive user experience sometimes means we can't include every possible feature or we need to consider the long-term design of how we want to support a feature area.

For a high-level overview of how Ternary works, please see the [Architecture Guide](./docs/architecture.md). Understanding the architecture will help ensure your contributions align with the overall design of the project.

## More than code contributions

Something that I really appreciate are all the non-code contributions, such as reporting bugs, writing feature requests and participating on [Ternary's sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ternarybuilders).

## Development

Ternary is an Electron app.

**Install dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

**Apply migrations:**

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```

**Run locally:**

```sh
npm start
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

```sh
npm test
```

### E2E tests

Build the app for E2E testing:

```sh
npm run pre:e2e
```

> Note: you only need to re-build the app when changing the app code. You don't need to re-build the app if you're just updating the tests.

Run the whole e2e test suite:

```sh
npm run e2e
```

Run a specific test file:

```sh
npm run e2e e2e-tests/context_manage.spec.ts
```

Update snapshots for a test:

```sh
npm run e2e e2e-tests/context_manage.spec.ts -- --update-snapshots
```
